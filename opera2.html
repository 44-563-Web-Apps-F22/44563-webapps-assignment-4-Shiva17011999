  <h5 class = "Zara">Zara:</h5><p class = "speech">Dear me.  I'm afraid we are interrupting a tete-a-tete.</p> 

  <h5 class = "Scaphio">Scaphio:</h5><p class = "speech">  (breathlessly)  No, no.  You come very appropriately.
  To be brief, we—we love you—this man and
  I—madly—passionately!</p>

  <h5 class = "Scaphio">Scaphio:</h5><p class = "speech">  And we don't know how we are to settle which of us is to
  marry you.</p>

  <h5 class = "Fitz">Fitz.:  </h5><p class = "speech">  Zara, this is very awkward.</p>

  <h5 class = "Scaphio">Scaphio:</h5><p class = "speech"> (very much overcome)  I—I am paralyzed by the
  singular radiance of your extraordinary loveliness.  I know I am
  incoherent.  I never was like this before—it shall not occur
  again.  I—shall be fluent, presently.</p>

  <h5 class = "Zara">Zara:  </h5>  <p class = "speech">(aside)  Oh, dear, Captain Fitzbattleaxe, what is to be
  done?</p> 

  <h5 class = "Fitz">Fitz.:  </h5><p class = "speech">  (aside)  Leave it to me—I'll manage it.  (Aloud)
  It's a common situation.  Why not settle it in the English
  fashion?</p>

  <h5 class = "Both">Both: </h5><p class = "speech">   The English fashion?  What is that?</p> 

  <h5 class = "Fitz">Fitz.: </h5><p class="speech">   It's very simple.  In England, when two gentlemen are in
  love with the same lady, and until it is settled which gentleman
  is to blow out the brains of the other, it is provided, by the
  Rival Admirers' Clauses Consolidation Act, that the lady shall be
  entrusted to an officer of Household Cavalry as stakeholder, who
  is bound to hand her over to the survivor (on the Tontine
  principle) in a good condition of substantial and decorative
  repair.</p>
