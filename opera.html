    ACT II
  Scene — Throne Room in the Palace.  Night.  Fitzbattleaxe
  discovered,
       singing to Zara.

                    RECITATIVE — Fitzbattleaxe.

            Oh, Zara, my beloved one, bear with me!
            Ah, do not laugh at my attempted C!
            Repent not, mocking maid, thy girlhood's choice—
            The fervour of my love affects my voice!

                       SONG — Fitzbattleaxe.

            A tenor, all singers above
                 (This doesn't admit of a question),
                      Should keep himself quiet,
                      Attend to his diet
                 And carefully nurse his digestion;
            But when he is madly in love
                 It's certain to tell on his singing—
                      You can't do the proper chromatics
                      With proper emphatics
                 When anguish your bosom is wringing!
            When distracted with worries in plenty,
            And his pulse is a hundred and twenty,
            And his fluttering bosom the slave of mistrust is,
            A tenor can't do himself justice,
                 Now observe—(sings a high note),
            You see, I can't do myself justice!
            I could sing if my fervour were mock,
                 It's easy enough if you're acting—
                      But when one's emotion
                      Is born of devotion
                 You mustn't be over-exacting.
            One ought to be firm as a rock
                 To venture a shake in vibrato,
                      When fervour's expected
                      Keep cool and collected
                 Or never attempt agitato.
            But, of course, when his tongue is of leather,
            And his lips appear pasted together,
            And his sensitive palate as dry as a crust is,
            A tenor can't do himself justice.
                 Now observe—(sings a high note),
            It's no use—I can't do myself justice!

  Zara:     Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
  qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
  notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
  thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
  (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
  hand in his), you have that already!

  Fitz.:    How good and wise you are!  How unerringly your
  practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
  material from the merely incidental!

  Zara:     My Girton training, Arthur.  At Girton all is wheat, and
  idle chaff is never heard within its walls!  But tell me, is not
  all working marvelously well?  Have not our Flowers of Progress
  more than justified their name?

  Fitz.:    We have indeed done our best.  Captain Corcoran and I
  have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
  services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
  trembles at the name of Utopia!

  Zara:     How clever of you!

  Fitz.:    Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
  Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
  with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
  idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
  full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
  never dreamt of!

  Zara:     But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
  ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
  that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
  applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
  man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
  restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
  christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
  Prospectus!

  Fitz.:    Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
  trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.

  Zara:     Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
  even to the costume of our people.  Discarding their own barbaric
  dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
  ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
  Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
  with clothing designed upon the most approved English
  models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
  things is to be held here this evening.

  Fitz.:    But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.

  Zara:     Ah, we've improved upon that.  We all look so much
  better by candlelight!  And when I tell you, dearest, that my
  Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am long-
  ing to go and try it on.

  Fitz.:    Then we must part?

  Zara:     Necessarily, for a time.

  Fitz.:    Just as I wanted to tell you, with all the passionate
  enthu-siasm of my nature, how deeply, how devotedly I love you!

  Zara:     Hush!  Are these the accents of a heart that really
  feels? True love does not indulge in declamation—its voice
  is sweet, and soft, and low.  The west wind whispers when he woos
  the poplars!

  DUET — Zara and Fitzbattleaxe.

  Zara:          Words of love too loudly spoken
                      Ring their own untimely knell;
                 Noisy vows are rudely broken,
                      Soft the song of Philomel.
                 Whisper sweetly, whisper slowly,
                      Hour by hour and day by day;
                 Sweet and low as accents holy
                      Are the notes of lover's lay.

  Both:          Sweet and low, etc.

  Fitz:          Let the conqueror, flushed with glory,
                      Bid his noisy clarions bray;
                 Lovers tell their artless story
                      In a whispered virelay.
                 False is he whose vows alluring
                      Make the listening echoes ring;
                 Sweet and low when all-enduring
                      Are the songs that lovers sing!

  Both:          Sweet and low, etc.

  (Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)

  King:     To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
  use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
  perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
  all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
  sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
  Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
  impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
  Articles of Association?

  Fitz.:    Sir, they are here.

  (Enter Lord Dramaleigh, Captain Corcoran, Sir Bailey Barre, Mr.
  Blushington, and Mr. Goldbury from different entrances.)

  King:     Oh!  (Addressing them)  Gentlemen, our daughter holds
  her first Drawing-Room in half an hour, and we shall have time to
  make our half-yearly report in the interval.  I am neces-sarily
  unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
  Council—perhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us in
  the way of doing the thing properly, and with due regard to the
  solemnity of the occasion.

  Lord D.:  Certainly—nothing simpler.  Kindly bring your
  chairs forward—His Majesty will, of course, preside.

  (They range their chairs across stage like Christy Minstrels.
  King sits center, Lord Dramaleigh on his left, Mr. Goldbury on his
  right, Captain Corcoran left of Lord Dramaleigh, Captain
  Fitzbattleaxe right of Mr. Goldbury, Mr. Blushington extreme
  right, Sir Bailey Barre extreme left.)

  King:     Like this?

  Lord D.:  Like this.

  King:     We take your word for it that this is all right.  You
  are not making fun of us?  This is in accordance with the prac-
  tice at the Court of St. James's?

  Lord D.:  Well, it is in accordance with the practice at the Court
  of St. James's Hall.

  King:     Oh! it seems odd, but never mind.

  SONG — King.

  Society has quite forsaken all her wicked courses. Which empties
  our police courts, and abolishes divorces.

  Chorus:   Divorce is nearly obsolete in England.

  King:     No tolerance we show to undeserving rank and splendour;
  For the higher his position is, the greater the offender.

  Chorus:   That's a maxim that is prevalent in England.

  King:     No peeress at our drawing-room before the Presence
  passes Who wouldn't be accepted by the lower middle-classes. Each
  shady dame, whatever be her rank, is bowed out neatly.

  Chorus:   In short, this happy country has been Anglicized
  completely Is really is surprising What a thorough Anglicizing We
  have brought about—Utopia's quite another land; In her
  enterprising movements, She is England—with improvements,
  Which we dutifully offer to our mother-land!

  King:     Our city we have beautified—we've done it willy-
  nilly— And all that isn't Belgrave Square is Strand and
  Piccadilly.

  Chorus:        We haven't any slummeries in England!

  King:     The chamberlain our native stage has purged beyond a
  question. Of "risky" situation and indelicate suggestion; No piece
  is tolerated if it's costumed indiscreetly—

  Chorus:        In short this happy country has been Anglicized
  com-pletely! It really is surprising, etc.

  King:     Our peerage we've remodelled on an intellectual basis,
  Which certainly is rough on our hereditary races—

  Chorus:        We are going to remodel it in England.

  King:     The Brewers and the Cotton Lords no longer seek
  admission, And literary merit meets with proper recognition—

  Chorus:        As literary merit does in England!

  King:     Who knows but we may count among our intellectual
  chickens, Like you, an Earl of Thackery and p'r'aps a Duke of
  Dickens— Lord Fildes and Viscount Millais (when they come)
  we'll welcome sweetly—

  Chorus:   In short, this happy country has been Anglicized
  completely! It really is surprising, etc.

  (At the end all rise and replace their chairs.)

  King:     Now, then, for our first Drawing-Room.  Where are the
  Prin-cesses?  What an extraordinary thing it is that since Euro-
  pean looking-glasses have been supplied to the Royal bed-rooms my
  daughters are invariably late!

  Lord D.:  Sir, their Royal Highnesses await your pleasure in the
  Ante-room.

  King:     Oh.  Then request them to do us the favor to enter at
  once.

  (Enter all the Royal Household, including (besides the Lord
  Chamber-lain) the Vice-Chamberlain, the Master of the Horse, the
  Master of the Buckhounds, the Lord High Treasurer, the Lord
  Steward, the Comptroller of the Household, the Lord-in-Waiting,
  the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting, the Gold and Silver Stick,
  and the Gentlemen Ushers.  Then enter the three Princesses (their
  trains carried by Pages of Honor), Lady Sophy, and the Ladies-in-
  Waiting.)

  King:     My daughters, we are about to attempt a very solemn
  ceremo-nial, so no giggling, if you please.  Now, my Lord Chamber-
  lain, we are ready.

  Lord D.:  Then, ladies and gentlemen, places, if you please.  His
  Maj-esty will take his place in front of the throne, and will be
  so obliging as to embrace all the debutantes.  (LADY SOPHY much
  shocked.)

  King:     What—must I really?

  Lord D.:  Absolutely indispensable.

  King:     More jam for the Palace Peeper!

  (The King takes his place in front of the throne, the Princess
  Zara on his left, the two younger Princesses on the left of Zara.)

  King:     Now, is every one in his place?

  Lord D.:  Every one is in his place.

  King:     Then let the revels commence.

  (Enter the ladies attending the Drawing-Room.  They give their
  cards to the Groom-in-Waiting, who passes them to the Lord-in-
  Waiting, who passes them to the Vice-Chamberlain, who passes them
  to the Lord Chamberlain, who reads the names to the King as each
  lady approaches.  The ladies curtsey in succession to the King and
  the three Princesses, and pass out.  When all the presentations
  have been accomplished, the King, Princesses, and Lady Sophy come
  forward, and all the ladies re-enter.)

                            RECITATIVE — King

            This ceremonial our wish displays
            To copy all Great Britain's courtly ways.
            Though lofty aims catastrophe entail,
            We'll gloriously succeed or nobly fail!

                        UNACCOMPANIED CHORUS

            Eagle High in Cloudland soaring—
                 Sparrow twittering on a reed—
            Tiger in the jungle roaring—
                 Frightened fawn in grassy mead—
            Let the eagle, not the sparrow,
            Be the object of your arrow—
                 Fix the tiger with your eye—
                 Pass the fawn in pity by.
                 Glory then will crown the day—
                 Glory, glory, anyway!

                                                               (Exit all.)
